# 5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
# describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
# should look something like this:

# • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
# evaluates to True or False.
# • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another
# 5 tests evaluate to False.
