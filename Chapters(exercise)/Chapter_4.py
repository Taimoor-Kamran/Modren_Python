# 4-1. Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these
# pizza names in a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
# â€¢ Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza,
# instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza, you should

# have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pep-
# peroni pizza.
